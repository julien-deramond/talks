## Orange Open-Source Design System and Its Bootstrap Fork

Orange Design System (ODS) is Orange’s open-source toolkit for product design and accessible digital experiences. It offers a comprehensive suite including a web framework, web libraries, mobile SDKs, and various tools, all of which are open-source and either utilize or are based on existing open-source software.

Join us as we explore this suite and its integration within the open-source community, uncovering how developers actively contribute to upstream projects. Additionally, learn about the notable involvement of some developers who are members of Bootstrap's core team; whose our web framework is a fork of.
